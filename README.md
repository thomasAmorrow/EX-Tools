# EX-tools
Collaborative space for Okeanos Explorer Colab Notebooks, Wiki, and other tools

Contains Google Colab Notebooks for EX data processing, analytics, and more. The hopeful goal is to build foundations for a unified ocean exploration data pipeline that is platform-agnostic, and can serve as a model for other ocean exploration operations.

Tools in this repository should
  - Accept raw data directly from instrumentation wherever possible
  - Avoid closed-source or proprietary interfaces
  - Come with clear documentation for continued use, adaptability, and future development
  - Conduct data within FAIR principles
  - Operate as "Notebook" style documents, showing intermediate results and operations
